# Libre Office Calc mini script to match data from worksheet 1 to worksheet 2

=match(A1, $Sheet2.$A$1:$A$100, 0)

# Calc will search sheet 2 column A between rows 1 and 100 for a matching value to the value in cell A1. 
# The "0" indicates you want an exact match. 
# This script will return the row number in sheet 2 that contains the matching value.

# To return a value from that row (from a separate column) to worksheet 1:
# In the next open column, concatenate "C" (or whatever column the value resides in) with the row number you just obtained.

=concatenate("C", B1)

# Copy/paste this value as just number and text into the next column. Then highlight the column and do a find/replace:
# Replace: C
# New value: =$Sheet2.C

# This will return the matching value from the row number you've found.
