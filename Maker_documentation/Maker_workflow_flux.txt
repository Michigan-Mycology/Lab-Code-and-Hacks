Instructions for running Maker annotation pipeline on Umich flux ( by Alisha Q)

1) Prepare Accessory inputs  (all or some or none may be used)
                a. Custom Repeat Library
                          -Run RepeatScout and then RepeatMasker to create custom repeat library for your species.
                b. Genemark-ES (not available on flux yet)
                          - create genemark model for your species
                          - perl /path/to/gm_es.pl your.assembly.fasta
                c. Assemble RNA for EST evidence
                          - Use Trinity or other assembler to create de novo RNA assembly

2) Load Maker (and dependent modules) via command line
       module remove ncbi-blast/2.2.29           ####people other than Alisha won't need to do this, I just always have this (default) version of blast+ loaded####
       module load med BioPerl/1.6.1 gcc/4.7.0 boost/1.54.0-gcc ncbi-blast/2.2.31
       module load lsa repeatmasker/4.0.6 exonerate/2.2.0
       module load lsa augustus/3.1 SNAP/20131129
       module load maker

3) Produce Maker control files
       maker -CTL
       
4) Edit Control files
       Using VI or another text editor, change the maker_opts.ctl to include the full paths to your genome.fas, your repeats.fas (from RepeatScout/Masker output), your assembled RNA (e.g. from Trinity), choose a model organism for augustus, your Genemark model, etc. etc.
       
       Repeat for maker_bopts.ctl and maker_exe.ctl, if there are parameters you want to change, otherwise just leave these alone!

5) From login node load all dependent modules (if you didn't do so in step #2!)
        I don't know why you can't load the module within your pbs file, but I'm pretty sure it has to do with the fact that we are using mpi between different nodes and cores, and basically the program just chokes if the modules are loaded within the pbs script, so there.

6) Run Maker on flux using pbs script provided (modified with your path, allocation requests, etc.)
       qsub maker.pbs
       The basic command within the pbs script is just "maker"  run from within the directory with your ctl files!
       It will run mpi if you have requested multiple cores (which will greatly reduce the amount of time Maker takes to run which is at a minimum ~12 hours!)
       
*****Post Processing*****
Once Maker has run, the resulting output folder will contain a datastore index file.  Accessory scripts included in the Maker package (module load maker , if you want to use them) will allow you to use the index file to create your final fasta and gff3 output files, as well as nifty things like renaming the Maker protein headers (which are disgusting!!).  Here are ones I commonly use:

fasta_merge -d datastore_indexfile -o prefix_for_output  #This creates all the protein and transcript fastas

gff3_merge -d datastore_indexfile -o my_new_maker.gff3

maker_map_ids --prefix YSPE_  --justify 5 --sort_order sort_order.tab my_new_maker.gff3 > genome_id.map          #First create a tab delimited file with your contig name and the order (0-N) that you want the contigs in.  The important function of this script is not the order of the contigs but the fact that proteins on a contig will be "in order" e.g. YSPE_00001 will be next to YSPE_00002 on a contig (if they are on the same contig. 

map_gff_ids genome_id.map my_new_maker.gff3
map_fasta_ids genome_id.map my_genome.proteins.fasta
