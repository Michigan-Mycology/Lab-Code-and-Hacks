# Libre Office Calc routine to link specimen data from different spreadsheets.

# Scenario: You are working with a large number of specimens and you have two spreadsheets containing different data about the specimens.
# The spreadsheets aren't completely equal in that one or both also contain data about specimens not found the second spreadsheet.
# For an example, lets say you produced DNA for a hundred specimens, and you did Microscopy on 500 and took a varying amount of images
# per specimen. Now you want to add the image names to your DNA spreadsheet to congregate your data to prepare for publication.

# Step 1: copy/paste your data into libre office calc into Sheet1 and the second into Sheet2 (tabs at the bottom left).
#
# Example data:
#
# Worksheet 1:                                  Worksheet 2:
# Column A    Column B    Column C              Column A        Column B
# ITS Genbank ITS FASTA   Specimen Number       Specimen Number Microscopy Images

# We want to search Worksheet 2 for specimen numbers that appear in Worksheet 1
#
# In worksheet 1, column D row 2 (assuming header in row 1), enter:

=match(C2, $Sheet2.$A$1:$A$500, 0)

# Calc will search worksheet 2 column A between rows 1 and 500 for a matching value to the value in cell C1.
# The "0" indicates you want an exact match. 
# This script will return the row number within your range you define in sheet 2 that contains the matching value.
# Always define your parameters starting with row 1, even with headers.
# Drag the lower right corner of this cell down the entire column to run the forumula on every specimen number.
#
# So now in Column D you have row numbers where there is a matching value. Now you want to return values from column B.
# In worksheet 1 column E, concatenate "B" (or whatever column the value resides in) with the row number you just obtained.

=concatenate("B", D2)

# Worksheet 1:

# Highlight all the values in column E and copy them. Highlight them again and right click and select paste special and choose to paste
# only number and text. This will ensure that just the values are in the cells and not the concatenate formulas.
#
# Highlight the values in the column again and do a find/replace routine:
# Replace: B
# New value: =$Sheet2.B
#
# This will return the values in the cell names you've specified.
