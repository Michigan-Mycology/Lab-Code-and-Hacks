Visualize your data - create an emergent self organizing map (ESOM).
#Modified and emended from the work out of Jill Banfield's lab. Greg Dick et al. 2009 Genome Biology. And Vincent Denef's version of the print_tetramer_freqs.pl perl script has been used.
#Example files and necessary scripts included in this folder as well (.lrn file was too big, so I had to gzip it!).

On the command line:

1. Generate input files for ESOM.

perl print_tetramer_freqs_esom.pl -s your_genome_assembly.fasta -m 1000 -w 3000 -k 4 

#s = your assembly
#m = minimum contig size to be analyzed (make this higher for faster/ less CPU intensive visualization)
#w = window size to calculate kmer frequency (again, make this higher for faster viz)
#k = kmer size, default is 4, longer means slower!
NOTE: you may need to type out full path for this perl script to work if not in same directory.

Output, 3 files: .lrn, .names, .cls files within your directory.

On a Mac, install the GUI from here: http://databionic-esom.sourceforge.net/

2. Load files into ESOM gui.

File -> load .lrn, then load .names, then load .cls

Tools -> training.  I use default options, except: 
   Training algorithm - K-batch
   Number of rows in map - 200
   Number of cols in map - 250 (product of rows x cols should be approximately 5-6x the # of windows, e.g. I have a 30,000,000 bp assembly, divide by 3000 [size of window] ) ****If ESOM training is taking too long to run (e.g. more than 24 hours), make these row and col values smaller to help out, or go back to the change the min contig or window size parameters.
   Start value for the radius - 50
   Number of epochs - 20

Hit start - training will take minutes to hours (more common) depending on the size of your dataset.

3. Vizualize output

View -> UMatrix background, tiled display.
#Use Zoom, Color, Bestmatch size to get desired view.

*****At this point only your ridges and valleys and the overall structure of your data will be displayed.*****
NOW, we can play around with adding information (annotating, if you will) those contigs (windows) that are displayed on your map.

Back to the command line: 
4. Using blastn or USEARCH, an algorithm, and Genbank nt or similar, a database, create a best blast hit for each contig. Use tabular format (6) for blast output.
#Talk about quick and dirty. Your best blastn hit could be spurious or as equally likely as the second or fourth best blastn hit, but in aggregate, we try to separate the data. For bacteria, this actually works quite well, for Eukaryotes the databases are sparser and therefore we give a best blastn hit less meaning. A top hit to ANY fungus is usually a definite for our targets, a top hit to animals (especially inverts) could still be fungal target though. I see this frequently.

Now we have to "assign the taxonomy" based on this best blast hit. Depending on how old your blast database is, you may (or may not, if it's the newest version of genbank db) be able to us this helpful script (included in directory):

perl blast_taxonomy_report.pl -blast contigs_nr.1e-8.txt -nodes nodes.dmp -names names.dmp -gi_taxid_file gi_taxid_nucl.dmp.gz
#Download the nodes.dmp, names.dmp, and gi_taxid_nucl.dmp.gz from Genbank's ftp site here: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/
#Files are too big for me to upload to GitHub.

With this output, we need to reformat to the "annotation" format taken by ESOM.  Here is an example of the top few lines of the annotation file.
contig  annotation
NODE_1147_length_2667_cov_16.2489	10
NODE_707_length_4433_cov_14.0962	10
NODE_329_length_11939_cov_66.1998	1
NODE_326_length_12118_cov_62.7537	1
NODE_2533_length_1171_cov_47.2948	1
NODE_1903_length_1542_cov_12.076	10
NODE_1518_length_1955_cov_17.2579	10
NODE_989_length_3135_cov_14.3055	10
NODE_1005_length_3078_cov_17.2253	10
NODE_988_length_3137_cov_10.7748	10
NODE_1225_length_2482_cov_16.2073	10
NODE_867_length_3613_cov_15.5486	10
NODE_1675_length_1764_cov_10.7923	10
NODE_458_length_7907_cov_59.2615	3

Save this file as your_metagenome.annotation

5. Finally rerun the print_tetramers script, to create a new .cls file for input into ESOM GUI.
This time:
perl print_tetramer_freqs_esom.pl -s your_metagenome_assembly.fas -m 1000 -w 3000 -k 4 -a your_metagenome.annotation

Now load the reulting new files into the ESOM GUI.
